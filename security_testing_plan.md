# RUSTCAT Security Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security testing strategy for RUSTCAT, a macOS-only, Rust-based native debugger. Given that debuggers operate with elevated privileges and interact with potentially untrusted inputs (debug targets, DWARF data, etc.), it's critical to establish robust security practices.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

- Validate all inputs from both users and target programs
- Implement privilege separation where possible
- Apply Rust's memory safety guarantees consistently

### 2. Least Privilege

- Only request necessary permissions from macOS
- Limit debugger's capabilities to what's needed for operation
- Isolate untrusted code and data

### 3. Secure by Design

- Apply threat modeling during design phase
- Consider security implications of each feature
- Document security assumptions

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Critical Security-Sensitive Areas:

- **Memory Management**
  - Test memory region bounds checking
  - Test validation of memory addresses
  - Test handling of invalid/unaligned memory access
  
- **Input Validation**
  - Test command parsing robustness
  - Test handling of malformed debug data
  - Test boundary conditions for all input parameters
  
- **Process Control**
  - Test proper error handling during debugging operations
  - Test proper cleanup on abnormal termination
  - Test handling of process manipulation edge cases

#### Implementation Plan:

1. Create `tests/` directory with the following structure:
   ```
   tests/
   ├── memory/
   ├── input/
   ├── process/
   ├── platform/
   └── integration/
   ```

2. Set up test infrastructure in Cargo.toml:
   - Add test dependencies: `proptest`, `test-case`, `mockall`
   - Configure test coverage reporting

### 2. Fuzz Testing

#### Areas to Fuzz:

- **DWARF/Symbol Parsing**
  - Fuzz DWARF data structures
  - Fuzz symbol tables and string tables
  
- **Command Input**
  - Fuzz command line arguments
  - Fuzz interactive commands
  
- **Memory Inspection**
  - Fuzz memory access patterns
  - Fuzz memory format conversions

#### Implementation Plan:

1. Set up cargo-fuzz infrastructure
2. Create fuzz targets for each critical component
3. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
4. Maintain corpus of interesting inputs

### 3. Static Analysis

- Enable and address all clippy lints, particularly security-focused ones
- Implement code security scanning through GitHub Actions
- Use cargo-audit to scan dependencies for vulnerabilities

### 4. Security-Specific Tests

- Test protection against time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities
- Test handling of maliciously crafted binaries
- Test resilience against debugger detection techniques

## Secure Development Practices

### Continuous Security Validation

- Add dependency vulnerability scanning (cargo audit)
- Implement security-focused code reviews
- Set up a responsible disclosure policy

### Documentation

- Document security model
- Maintain threat model documentation
- Document security assumptions and limitations

### Code Review Checklist

- Ensure proper error handling
- Check for buffer overflows/underflows (even with Rust's safety)
- Verify proper authentication and authorization
- Check for proper input validation
- Verify secure memory management
- Check for race conditions

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Security Infrastructure (Immediate)

1. Set up basic unit testing framework
2. Enable all clippy lints
3. Add cargo-audit and security scanning
4. Create security documentation template

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing (Short-term)

1. Implement unit tests for critical components
2. Set up initial fuzzing infrastructure
3. Create malformed input test suite
4. Develop security-specific test cases

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Testing (Mid-term)

1. Expand fuzzing coverage
2. Implement integration tests with malicious binary samples
3. Conduct thread safety and race condition tests
4. Perform time-of-check/time-of-use vulnerability testing

### Phase 4: Security Hardening (Long-term)

1. Implement sandboxing for parsing untrusted data
2. Add integrity verification for debugger components
3. Implement advanced anomaly detection
4. Create automated security regression tests

## Conclusion

By implementing this security testing plan, RUSTCAT will establish a strong security foundation. Given the sensitive nature of debuggers and their access to system resources, this proactive approach to security will ensure the project maintains high security standards as it evolves.
