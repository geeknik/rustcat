# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Mach Kernel Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core functionality for interacting with macOS Mach kernel APIs to control and inspect processes.
# Details:
Implement process attachment, memory reading/writing, register access, and thread control using mach_vm APIs and ptrace.

# Implementation Notes:
- Implemented MacOS-specific Mach kernel integration in platform/macos.rs
- Fixed pointer cast issues in memory reading/writing functions
- Added proper error handling for Mach API calls
- Fixed documentation formatting and backticks
- Improved memory safety with better bounds checking
- Structured code to handle error cases more consistently

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each Mach API wrapper function and integration tests for process control flow.
