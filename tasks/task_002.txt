# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Terminal UI Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a responsive terminal user interface using ratatui/crossterm with proper layouts and components.
# Details:
Create a modular TUI framework that supports various views (code, memory, registers, stack), responsive layouts, and efficient rendering. Implement proper input handling for keyboard/mouse events and ensure UI updates don't block the debugger.

# Implementation Notes:
- Added frame time tracking to measure UI performance for sub-10ms requirement
- Added performance metrics display in status bar with color coding (green/yellow/red)
- Implemented F3 key binding to toggle performance metrics display
- Added context-sensitive keyboard shortcut help bar
- Implemented F1 key binding to toggle detailed help overlay
- Improved the status bar to show more useful information
- Fixed a critical borrowing issue in the main loop that was causing compiler errors
- Converted mutable references to immutable where possible
- Fixed UI function signatures to be more efficient
- Implemented proper error handling for UI rendering functions

# Test Strategy:
Test UI rendering performance with benchmarks, ensure responsive input handling, and verify proper layout in different terminal sizes.
