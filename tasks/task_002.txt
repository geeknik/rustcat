# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Terminal UI Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a responsive terminal user interface using ratatui/crossterm with proper layouts and components.
# Details:
Create a modular TUI framework that supports various views (code, memory, registers, stack), responsive layouts, and efficient rendering. Implement proper input handling for keyboard/mouse events and ensure UI updates don't block the debugger.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI rendering performance with benchmarks, ensure responsive input handling, and verify proper layout in different terminal sizes.
