# üß† RUSTCAT

A MacOS-Only, Rust-Based, Fast-as-Hell Native Debugger

## TL;DR

You're staring down the future of native code debugging on macOS ARM64. RUSTCAT is not a gdb wrapper. It is not a hacked lldb clone. It is a from-scratch debugger built for speed, terminal warriors, and modern machines. ClickHouse-sized workloads? Handled. Real-time updates? You bet. UI freezes? Not in this house.

This is the debugger macOS should ship with, but doesn't. So we did it ourselves.

## üß© Core Features

- **MacOS ARM64 Only**: Built specifically for Apple Silicon
- **‚ö° Fast**: Zero-wait responsiveness for all interactive commands
- **üëÅ TUI**: Terminal UI with keyboard-driven interface
- **üî¨ From-Scratch**: Custom-built debug engine (no LLDB or GDB)
- **üßµ Multithreaded**: Background worker pools for heavy operations
- **üîß Low-level**: Uses macOS-specific APIs for ptrace, mach threads, etc.
- **üîÑ Dynamic Symbols**: C++ name demangling and advanced symbol resolution
- **üìä Rich Memory Views**: Inspect memory as hex, ASCII, integers, floats, etc.
- **üßµ Advanced Breakpoints**: Conditions, ignore counts, log messages
- **üìä Thread Management**: Track thread states, build call stacks, manage thread-specific breakpoints
- **üîí Security-First**: Comprehensive security testing infrastructure to ensure memory safety and robust handling of malicious inputs

## üöÄ Performance

- **Instantaneous** (sub-10ms) UI redraws, navigation, breakpoint setting
- **Efficient** multi-threaded parsing of DWARF/ELF/Mach-O
- **Handles** large binaries (2.5GB+ tested)

## üñ• Interface

Terminal-Only UI with vi-like keyboard shortcuts:
- Split Panels: Code view | Stack trace | Memory | Threads
- Dynamic Layout: Resizable panes, toggleable regions
- Keyboard-Driven: g (go), s (step), f (stack frame), / (search), : (command mode)

## Current Status

RUSTCAT is currently in alpha development. The core debugger engine is functional, supporting breakpoints, memory inspection, and thread management. The TUI interface is operational with multiple views:

- Code view for source code examination
- Memory view with hex, ASCII, and various numeric formats
- Thread inspection showing thread states and locations
- Call stack view with source location information
- Command input with history and tab-completion
- Expression evaluation for inspecting variables and memory
- Variable inspection with type information display

## üõ† Running the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/rustcat.git
cd rustcat

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run with a target program
cargo run -- /path/to/program

# Or use the provided run script
./run.command /path/to/program
```

## üìã Requirements

- macOS Ventura or later
- Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 (ARM64)
- Rust and Cargo installed

**Note:** While RUSTCAT is designed specifically for macOS on Apple Silicon, the codebase can be built on other platforms for development and contribution purposes. However, debugging functionality will only be available on macOS.

## Keyboard Controls

- `q`: Quit
- `g`: Run/continue program
- `b`: Set breakpoint
- `s`: Step instruction
- `n`: Step over
- `c`: Switch to code view
- `m`: Switch to memory view
- `r`: Switch to registers view
- `w`: Switch to stack view (call stack)
- `t`: Switch to threads view
- `f`: Switch to function trace view
- `v`: Switch to variables view
- `:`: Switch to command mode
- `Tab`: Switch between UI panels

## Command Mode

Enter command mode with `:` and type commands like:
- `break main` - Set breakpoint at main function
- `break 0x1000` - Set breakpoint at memory address
- `continue` - Continue execution
- `step` - Step into
- `next` - Step over
- `memory 0x1000 100` - View 100 bytes of memory at address 0x1000
- `print expr` - Evaluate and print expression
- `display expr` - Add expression to watch list (displayed each time program stops)
- `watch 0x1000` - Set a read/write watchpoint at address 0x1000
- `rwatch 0x1000` - Set a read watchpoint at address 0x1000
- `wwatch 0x1000` - Set a write watchpoint at address 0x1000
- `unwatch 0x1000` - Remove watchpoint at address 0x1000
- `watchlist` - List all active watchpoints
- `traceon` - Enable function call tracing
- `traceoff` - Disable function call tracing
- `traceclear` - Clear function call trace
- `tracefilter main` - Only trace functions containing "main"
- `traceclearfilters` - Clear all trace filters
- `help` - Show help

## üß¨ Philosophy

You shouldn't wait to debug your code.
You shouldn't fight your tools.
You shouldn't be forced to read Apple crash dumps to learn assembly.

Rustcat is the debugger Mac deserves. Clean. Deterministic. Free.
No more syscalls in the dark. Let's light this up.

## üîí Security Testing Infrastructure

RUSTCAT includes a comprehensive security testing framework to ensure memory safety and robust handling of hostile inputs:

- **Unit Tests**: Focused tests for memory bounds checking, command parsing, and input validation
- **Fuzzing**: Automated discovery of security issues with custom fuzz targets for binary parsing, DWARF data handling, and command input
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that validate security aspects of full debugger workflows
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Ensuring performance characteristics even with malicious inputs
- **Security Documentation**: Guidelines and checklists for secure development

All security tests are automatically run via GitHub Actions to prevent regressions.
