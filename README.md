## What is RUSTCAT?

RUSTCAT is not a gdb wrapper. It is not a hacked lldb clone. It is a from-scratch debugger built for speed, terminal warriors, and modern machines. ClickHouse-sized workloads? Handled. Real-time updates? You bet. UI freezes? Not in this house.

This is the debugger macOS should ship with, but doesn't. So we did it ourselves.

## Features

- ‚ö° **Blazing Fast**: Zero-wait responsiveness for all interactive commands
- üß† **Smart Parsing**: Robust symbol and DWARF debug info handling
- üñ•Ô∏è **Beautiful TUI**: Terminal-based UI with vi-like navigation
- üîç **Deep Inspection**: Memory, registers, threads, and more at your fingertips
- üßµ **Multi-threaded**: Background operations for heavy lifting tasks

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Basic TUI with four-panel layout
- ‚úÖ Symbol loading
- ‚úÖ DWARF debug info parsing
- ‚úÖ Mach-O format support
- üöß Breakpoints and stepping (WIP)
- üöß Memory inspection (WIP)
- üöß Registers view (WIP)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS Ventura or later on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Rust nightly toolchain

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/rustcat.git
cd rustcat

# Build with cargo
cargo build --release

# Install to your path (optional)
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Debug a binary
rustcat /path/to/binary

# With arguments
rustcat /path/to/binary arg1 arg2
```

## Usage

Once in the TUI:

- **Navigation**: `h` (left), `l` (right) to switch between panes
- **Quit**: `q` to exit
- **Commands** (coming soon):
  - `b <address/function>` - Set breakpoint
  - `c` - Continue
  - `s` - Step instruction
  - `r` - Run/restart
  - `:` - Command mode

## Under the Hood

RUSTCAT is built from scratch with:

- **Core Engine**: Custom debug engine using Mach kernel APIs
- **Symbol Parsing**: Native Mach-O and DWARF parsing
- **TUI**: Built with ratatui and crossterm for a beautiful terminal interface
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## Roadmap

- **v0.1**: Basic debugging features, symbol loading, TUI
- **v0.2**: Breakpoints, stepping, memory viewing
- **v0.3**: Advanced features like conditional breakpoints, watchpoints
- **v0.4**: Performance optimizations and larger binary support
