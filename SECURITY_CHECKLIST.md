# RUSTCAT Security Checklist

This document serves as a practical security checklist for developers working on RUSTCAT. It should be consulted when making changes to the codebase to ensure security principles are followed.

## Code Review Security Checklist

### Memory Safety

- [ ] Validate memory access bounds before reading/writing
- [ ] Check for potential integer overflows in memory address calculations
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for memory operations
- [ ] Verify memory regions have appropriate permissions before access

### Input Validation

- [ ] Sanitize all user input before processing
- [ ] Validate command arguments (range, type, format)
- [ ] Check for edge cases in numeric inputs
- [ ] Handle unexpected Unicode or special characters

### Error Handling

- [ ] Handle all possible error conditions appropriately
- [ ] Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] Ensure errors don't leave system in inconsistent state
- [ ] Log meaningful error information for debugging

### Resource Management

- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of resources on all code paths
- [ ] Prevent resource exhaustion (file handles, memory)
- [ ] Check for potential deadlocks or race conditions
- [ ] Verify that resources are released even in error cases

### Process Control

- [ ] Validate target processes before attaching
- [ ] Handle process termination gracefully
- [ ] Use proper security checks when attaching to processes
- [ ] Prevent privilege escalation

### Platform Security

- [ ] Follow macOS-specific security best practices
- [ ] Use secure API calls for system interaction
- [ ] Request only necessary permissions
- [ ] Validate platform-specific behavior

## Before Submitting Code

- [ ] Run static analysis tools (clippy with all lints)
- [ ] Execute all unit tests
- [ ] Run security-focused tests for affected components
- [ ] Check for potential timing attacks in security-critical code
- [ ] Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify all TODOs and FIXMEs have been addressed

## Security Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for security-critical functionality
- [ ] Create test cases for boundary conditions
- [ ] Add fuzz tests for input handling
- [ ] Test error paths and exception handling

## Code Quality

- [ ] Keep functions small and focused
- [ ] Follow Rust best practices for safety
- [ ] Use Rust's type system to prevent errors
- [ ] Prefer panic-free error handling in production code
- [ ] Document security assumptions and requirements

## Dependencies

- [ ] Review security implications of new dependencies
- [ ] Keep dependencies up to date
- [ ] Verify that dependencies follow security best practices
- [ ] Limit dependency scope to what's necessary

## Documentation

- [ ] Document security-critical components
- [ ] Include security considerations in API documentation
- [ ] Document threat models for sensitive features
- [ ] Document required security testing for new features

## Regular Security Tasks

- [ ] Run cargo-audit regularly to check for dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update dependencies to fix security issues promptly
- [ ] Review and update this security checklist as needed
- [ ] Conduct periodic security reviews of critical code
